I. INTRODUCTION

The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming everyday
appliances into intelligent systems that enhance user
convenience and efficiency. Among these, refrigerators have
evolved beyond simple cooling devices to incorporate smart
features that streamline food management, reduce wastage,
and optimize energy consumption. Traditional refrigerators
lack automated inventory tracking, requiring users to
manually check and remember stored items. This often leads
to food spoilage, duplicate purchases, and improper
temperature settings that compromise food quality and
energy efficiency.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), nearly one-third of all food produced globally is
wasted, with household food spoilage being a major
contributor. A significant portion of this waste occurs due to
a lack of awareness about stored food and its expiration
dates. Additionally, improper temperature settings result in
energy inefficiencies, increasing electricity consumption and
operational costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates
an intelligent refrigerator system capable of real-time food
